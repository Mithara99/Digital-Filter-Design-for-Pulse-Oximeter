# Digital-Filter-Design-for-Pulse-Oximeter

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was discovered from Wuhan, China, causing a series of acute respiratory disease termed COVID-19. This virus is transmittable between humans and has caused a pandemic worldwide giving rise to a large number of death toll globally. Various safety measures such as social distancing and lockdowns, were taken in order to minimize the spread of the virus and many research and developments were carried out to prevent COVID-19. Among such developments, pulse oximeters became much popular due to its capability of measuring the blood-oxygen level in a simple way with higher accuracy. This work is based on the digital filter design in pulse oximeters, and filter performance of them.
